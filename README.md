All labs and PEXs in this repo recieved full crediit. Please document if 
using as reference.

## Labs
Labs due the night before every lesson, starting at L09.
Main purpose is to practice skills learned in class.

### Lab09
Kind of a mess. Messed around in CLion with, getting used to making header, 
function, and CMake files.

### Lab10
Things are taking shape. Practiced new concepts in C, such as switches and... ok just 
switches.

### Lab11
For loop practice. I'm unreasonably proud of the Floyd's Triangle code.

### Lab12
While loop practice. Nothing special about this lab.

### Lab13
Pointer practice. This sucks.

### Lab14
Array practice. The instructors' implementation of this lab was **way** too clunky for this simple lab. Also, 
this lab has a severe lack of documentation on my part.

### Lab15
More array practice. Just an iteration on the last lab to make it work for a single 2-D array rather than multiple 1-D
arrays.

## PEX
What does PEX really stand for? No one really knows.
These are projects that aren't really attached to any particular lesson.

### PEX1
Pigs! It's a gambling man's game and a boring one at that. Finished in one afternoon
so there's barely any documentation, which I'll need to fix. GG No Re, I hate auto 
grader.

Also, there were some functions that would've worked WAY BETTER with pass by reference 
functions! We already did that so why didn't zybooks allow it? Only the dean knows
and he left on Friday.
