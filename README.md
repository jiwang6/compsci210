# compsci210
This repo is to document all labs and PEXs created
in cs210, intro to C.

## Labs
Labs due the night before every lesson, starting at L09.
Main purpose is to practice skills learned in class.

### Lab09
Kind of a mess. Messed around in CLion with, getting used to making header, 
function, and CMake files.

### Lab10
Things are taking shape. Practiced new concepts in C, such as switches and... ok just 
switches.

### Lab11
For loop practice. I'm unreasonably proud of the Floyd's Triangle code.

### Lab12
While loop practice. Nothing special about this lab.

### Lab13
Pointer practice. This sucks.

## PEX
What does PEX really stand for? No one really knows.
These are projects that aren't really attached to any particular lesson.

### PEX01
