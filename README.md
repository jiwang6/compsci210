All labs and PEXs in this repo received full credit. Please document if
using as reference.

## Labs
Labs due the night before every lesson, starting at L09.
Main purpose is to practice skills learned in class.

### Lab09
Kind of a mess. Messed around in CLion with, getting used to making header,
function, and CMake files.

### Lab10
Things are taking shape. Practiced new concepts in C, such as switches and... ok just
switches.

### Lab11
For loop practice. I'm unreasonably proud of the Floyd's Triangle code.

### Lab12
While loop practice. Nothing special about this lab.

### Lab13
Pointer practice. This sucks.

### Lab14
Array practice. Implementation of this lab was **way** too clunky for this simple lab. Also,
this lab has a severe lack of documentation on my part.

### Lab15
More array practice. Just an iteration on the last lab to make it work for a single 2-D array rather than multiple 1-D
arrays.

### Lab16
Some programming practice for PA2.

### Lab19
Character array practice. Last function is jank.

### Lab20
Aside from the 3 lines of formatted output, I honestly have no idea what the point of this lab was. Just repeated
concepts previously practiced.

### Lab22
Completion of lab relied heavily on other students. Need to review file IO and datastructures for future labs and
assessments.

### Lab23
Mainly file IO practice with a tinge of memory allocation. Lab24 should have more practice with malloc, calloc, free,
etc.

### Lab24
Literally just realloc() practice. Check the code not working at all and me failing
this class tbh lmfao.

## PEX
What does PEX really stand for? No one really knows.
These are projects that aren't really attached to any particular lesson.

### PEX1
Pigs! It's a gambling man's game and a boring one at that. Finished in one afternoon
so there's barely any documentation, which I'll need to fix. GG No Re, I hate auto
grader.

Also, there were some functions that would've worked WAY BETTER with pass by reference
functions! We already did that so why didn't zybooks allow it? Only the dean knows
and he left on Friday.

### PEX2
i'm about y33t myself into the abyss because of this class

## Misc
Random C projects I might create for cyber or whatever.

### lefty
Writes reskinned brainf**k, but for left handed people! Part of President's Cup Team Round 1, 2019.

### PA2
Don't worry about it :^)

Honor? I hardly know 'er!
