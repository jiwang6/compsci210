# compsci210
Follow along as I slowly lose my sanity and start questioning my spiritual upbringing
just because of this class. Document me if you use as reference so I don't get an
honor hit please thank you.

## Labs
Skills practice from ZYBooks. Very strong inverse correlation between the lab number
and quality of code.

### Lab09
Kind of a mess. Messed around in CLion with, getting used to making header,
function, and CMake files.

### Lab10
Things are taking shape. Practiced new concepts in C, such as switches and... ok just
switches.

### Lab11
For loop practice. I'm unreasonably proud of the Floyd's Triangle code.

### Lab12
While loop practice. Nothing special about this lab.

### Lab13
Pointer practice. This sucks.

### Lab14
Array practice. Implementation of this lab was **way** too clunky for this simple lab. Also,
this lab has a severe lack of documentation on my part.

### Lab15
More array practice. Just an iteration on the last lab to make it work for a single 2-D array rather than multiple 1-D
arrays.

### Lab16
Some programming practice for PA2.

### Lab19
Character array practice. Last function is jank.

### Lab20
Aside from the 3 lines of formatted output, I honestly have no idea what the point of this lab was. Just repeated
concepts previously practiced.

### Lab22
Completion of lab relied heavily on other students. Need to review file IO and datastructures for future labs and
assessments.

### Lab23
Mainly file IO practice with a tinge of memory allocation. Lab24 should have more practice with malloc, calloc, free,
etc.

### Lab24
Literally just realloc() practice. Check the code not working at all and me failing
this class tbh lmfao.

### Lab25
Uhhhhhh double pointers and malloc. We need pointers to other character pointers damnit!

### Lab28
Literally the most autistic and clunky code I've ever written. Doesn't even pass ZyBooks.

## PEX
What does PEX really stand for? No one really knows.
These are projects that aren't really attached to any particular lesson.

### PEX1
Pigs! Gambling game...? Finished in one afternoon
so there's barely any documentation, which I'll need to fix. GG No Re, I hate auto
grader.

Also, there were some functions that would've worked WAY BETTER with pass by reference
functions! We already did that so why didn't zybooks allow it? Only the dean knows
and he left on Friday.

### PEX2
Genome sequencing lab. Basically just comparing a sequence with sections from a larger genome or whatever.
Only important thing: strings are character pointers and can be incremented.

## Misc
Random C projects I might create for cyber or whatever.

### lefty
Writes reskinned brainf**k, but for left handed people! Part of President's Cup Team Round 1, 2019.

### PA2
Don't worry about it :^)
